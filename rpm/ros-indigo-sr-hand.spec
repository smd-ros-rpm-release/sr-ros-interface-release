%description
This is a ROS interface to the Shadow Robot's robotic hand. It contains both an
interface to the real hand (communicating via a CAN interface) and a simulated
version of the hand. It also contains an interface to Shadow Robot's muscle arm.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
